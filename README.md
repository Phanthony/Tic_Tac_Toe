Tic Tac Toe

Allows between 2-3 players to play in a NxM board with K in a row to win. Players can enter their names and choose a color for their "game piece"

To run the program just run the main file which would be InnerTTTController.kt

Main program is resizable, and can run any sized board, but can only show buttons until the buttons can't become smaller.

When creating a game an error will show up if you try to enter 0 for either N, M or K. Will also give an error if K is bigger than N or M.

Program will also allow for undoing moves based on last move made all the way up the creation of the game.
